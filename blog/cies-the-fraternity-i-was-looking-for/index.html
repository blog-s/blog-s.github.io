Who knows‚Ä¶ maybe in the future we can find a few Greek letters, build dorms in the house and Dr Kennell could be our president, we could recruit some people and make some jokes to the pledges lol</p><hr/><p>Maybe you are wondering what CIES is? CIES means Center for Intensive English Studies, there are different centers around USA, the one that I‚Äôm going to talk about is the CIES at Florida State University.</p><p>What I was doing there? Well‚Ä¶ since I was in high school I‚Äôve enjoyed watching the american movies about colleges and fraternities, those are things that we don‚Äôt have here in Colombia, I mean, of course we have colleges, but not THAT kind of colleges, you know.. So, I decided to go to the states and experience the college lifestyle, basically I didn‚Äôt care if I was going to an English course, an Italian course or a Spanish course, even when Spanish is my native language üòÄ</p><p>After looking for while, I decided to go to University of Arkansas, yeah, that‚Äôs right, the one in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</p><p>In my efforts to improve my English, I signed up in a language exchange website, it was a very big coincidence that I finished talking with one girl from Tallahassee, she was a student at FSU interested on practicing her Spanish. We talked about a lot of things, one of those things was about she planning to go to Peru again, and myself planning to go to the States, she told me UofA was located in the middle of nowhere and I should go to Tally instead; that was a nice talk‚Ä¶</p><p>I started searching and investigating about <strong>FSU</strong>, I really liked what I saw and I decided to change my destination, <u>one of the cleverest decision of my life.</u> (it doesn‚Äôt mean that Arkansas is bad, I just want to say that I had a great time in Florida)</p><hr/><h2>A big world in one place</h2><p>Something amazing about CIES is the diversity that you can find in this place, one second you are talking with someone from China, in the other one with someone from Saudi Arabia; you can find people from all around the world!!</p><p>If I had to make a list of all the countries, It would take me like for ever, but, you can have an idea about it: I met people from China, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Per√∫, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, and some other countries from Africa that I don‚Äôt remember.</p><p><figure class="gatsby-resp-image-figure">

They are different spots around campus where you can find one, also people like going to the bars and downtown to celebrate.</p><p>In 2015, Seminoles won 27 -2 vs the Gators (University of Florida) and 29-24 vs Hurricanes (University of Miami)</p><blockquote><p>So, The Florida State University Seminoles are a good team and they <del>nailed</del> nole it</p></blockquote><hr/><h2>High Quality Education and free TOEFL classes</h2><div class="image-left"><p><figure class="gatsby-resp-image-figure">

Just picture this, you are in room, everybody in the room speaks different languages and you have to find a way to communicate with them, well, let me tell you that they teach very well, I found people that didn‚Äôt speak speak English the first days, and, at the end of the session, they will be able to speak fluently.</p><p>Also, you have the opportunity to take free TOEFL classes. The teacher is Soli, a fantastic guy, Mondays and Thursdays he teaches TOEFL. A big percent of the students at CIES want or need to take the test, and almost all of them get the required score thanks to his classes.</p><p>Other nice thing about the teachers and the teaching methodology is that they are fresh, they are young, you know, the teachers are like your buddies, they are always in a good mode and willing to help you out in anything you need.</p><p>Many of the teachers and staff at CIES are local people as well, so, if you are looking for something to do or some place where to go, you can just talk with them and that‚Äôs it.</p><p>For example, if you like traveling and nature, you can speak with Josh, you can check his <a href="https://safensoundinlebanon.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blog here</a>, or you can speak with Calyn who give us a huge list of things to do in Tally.</p><hr/><h2>The house is open</h2><p>I talked to you before about the diversity at CIES, and one of the opportunities that we have to show up our world to the university and Tallahassee is with one event called Open House. On that day we are organized for world zones (Latinos together, Asians together etc) to decorate some rooms with every culture, with music and food. We open CIES to everybody to show what we do and explain our lifestyle in our countries.</p><div class="image-right"><p><figure class="gatsby-resp-image-figure">

So, that day you could find your friends and teachers wearing all type of costumes around the house.</p><p>Also at FSU you have all kind of facilities to practice almost any sport you want, so, there are not excuses. I played soccer a few times but I need to admit that I‚Äôm not that great, but, dude!! I just did it for fun, the score doesn‚Äôt matter üòõ , however I won a trophy with my friend Marco and other people, we were the champions of small international tournament, so, something is something.</p><hr/><h2>To keep in Mind</h2><p>I‚Äôm not quite sure if I‚Äôm the best to give advice, despite that, I think I can let you know some things before you hitting to Tally</p><p><strong>1. Tallahassee is the capital of florida</strong>, but still, it‚Äôs not that big like Miami or NY, and that is fine!!! Tally is more like a College Town, that is great if you like college lifestyle like me, also the Greek system is pretty solid, and it has a lot spaces where to do outdoors activities as well.</p><p><strong>2. Don‚Äôt be late in Classes</strong>, I know it looks simple, but, I was late like almost every day and I don‚Äôt feel proud about it, you don‚Äôt wanna miss the lessons.</p><p><strong>3. Learn how to Cook</strong> Do you know how many times I did cook something on my five months in the States? Zero!!! I went to a buffet almost all the days, also I was very lucky to have Blanca, my friend that help me out. So, keep in mind that nobody is going to be babysitting you. Learn how to cook anything, it could be just a bowl of rice or something.</p><p><strong>4. Sports</strong>, how I told you before, there are a lot places were to do sports in Tally, also you can use the FSU gym for free if you are a CIES student, and almost all the apartments complexes have GYM, some of them 24/7.</p><p><strong>5. Housing</strong>, I lived in Seminole Grand, it was fine for me, maybe sometimes you can have some noise neighbors, so, with some earplugs you will be fine.</p><p><strong>6. Bars and Clubs</strong>, I‚Äôm not a crazy guy about partying every weekend, however I did have fun in some clubs even when I don‚Äôt <del>know how to</del> dance, you can go to The Strip, Encore, Coliseum, Rokbar, Potbelly‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶</p><div class="full-width"><p><figure class="gatsby-resp-image-figure">
